Thank you again for the opportunity to complete the test task.

I didn't fully figure out with `Eslint`. Maybe because is automatically created by `Vite` would have been enough for me.

I'm also not sure if I did everything required in the backend task.

If you have any comments or suggestions for changes, I would appreciate it.
